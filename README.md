Hello Friends, my name is Rishi. I'm in Grade 7, studying at WP. My interests lay at Data Science, Machine learning, AI, and Computer programming. Currently learning python, html, and css. I'm also looking for certifications, open source courses, and etc. I do this because, I'm trying to get ahead, and prepare my expertise in Computer Science. My objective is to learn in advance, and advance my knowledge of Computer Science, to hopefully get a job at one of the big six; Google, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Facebook, and Instagram. Currently scouting for beginner certifications, open-source courses in languages such as, javascript, r, sql, and more. It would be incredible, if there was any folks that could send me links or websites, where I can find courses, and certifications at a beginner level, and suggest tips, and possible future advice. That would be greatly appreciated.
